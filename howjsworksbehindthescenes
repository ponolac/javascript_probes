js is hosted in some environment, most typically a browser, that's where js runs.

There can also be other hosts such as node.js web server, or some applications that accept js code input.

Js code behind the scenes: 

generally, the host has a js engine that takes the code and executes it

    • In the engine, first the code gets parsed by a parser (checks if code syntax is correct).
		
            •  If there is a syntax error, it throws an error and stops the execution.

            •  If syntax is ok, then the parser produces a data structure called Abstract Syntax Tree, which is then translated into machine code.

    • The code runs when it has been converted to machine code. 

    // Execution contexts and the execution stack

    All js code needs to run in an environment, and these environments are called execution contexts.

    execution context: a box, container, or wrapper which stores variables and in which a piece of code is evaluated and executed.

    The default execution context is always the global context.
