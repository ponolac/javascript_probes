js is hosted in some environment, most typically a browser, that's where js runs.

There can also be other hosts such as node.js web server, or some applications that accept js code input.

Js code behind the scenes: 

    • The host has some kind of js engine that takes the code and executes it.

    • In the engine, first the code gets parsed by a parser (checks if code syntax is correct).
		
    •  If there is a syntax error, it throws a code and stops the execution.

    •  If syntax is ok, then the parser produces a data structure called Abstract Syntax Tree, which is then translated into machine code.

    • The code runs when it has been converted to machine code.
